	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		I made this app, because I really liked Habitica when it was working
		well. But, it had some missing features that I really needed like being
		able to see things temporally and not just as a list. Additionally, the
		fantasy genre doesn't pique my interest like other genres do. People
		have already made alternatives on iOS and Android, but they don't
		respect that the data belongs to the person using the app. I want to
		access my data via API and export, and I don't want to be forced to
		interact with an app directly in order to make good use of it.
	</p>

	<p>
		This app may not satisfy everyone's tastes, but if you're looking for a
		free Habitica alternative, this is a good option.
	</p>

	<p>
		This app is independently developed and maintained by one person.
		Profits, if any, go to paying his rent and caring for his 3 dogs.
